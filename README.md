## Simplex algorithm

Implementation of the simplex algorithm that shows the intermediate tables as presented in the book
"Programación Lineal y Entera", Eduardo Ramos Méndez.

It supports the use of "Big-M" notation to get the first feasible base.

Hope that it can be usefull for some poor student who also makes lots of mistakes with those damn tables.

# Compilation

```
g++ simplex.cpp
```
